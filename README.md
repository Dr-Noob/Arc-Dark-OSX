# Arc-Dark-OSX
Arc-Dark based theme inspired by OSX for Openbox. It's mainly based on [this theme](https://www.box-look.org/p/1152798/), but with a dark style

You should be able to install it as any openbox theme: Move folder(in this case, `Arc-Dark-OSX`) to `/usr/share/themes`. Then use `lxappearance`, `obconf` or similar to set the theme.
